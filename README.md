# Food review site

A responsive food review site fetching data from Zomato, design inspired by Wolt.

## The problem

Fetched data from Zomato API whereafter I store the data paths I want to use by map method. Spent a lot of time on the sort and filter functions and how to call these, where I tried out a couple of different approaches. Styling was inspired by Wolt, which was my first go on trying to copy the feel from another site - superfun!
